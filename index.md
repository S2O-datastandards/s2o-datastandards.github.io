# S2O Data Standards

This project leads the development of community-driven data and metadata standards to facilitate and improve the interoperability of Environmental Health Science (EHS) data from distinct but related subdomains. We are engaging both standards and ontology developers, as well as subject matter experts across the different EHS subdomains to guide standards creation. Our approach will leverage the existing Aggregate Exposure Pathway (AEP) and Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) mechanistic frameworks to organize efforts linking subdomains across the source-to-outcome (S2O) continuum.

## Overview

{% capture text %}

Opportunities and needs for developing these Standards and Terminologies (S&T) requirements will be gathered by engaging subject matter experts and stakeholders (workgroup members) via a series of focused workshops for discrete phases along the S2O continuum.

This project will expand the Biolink Model to better distinguish biomarker measurements from the biological events those biomarkers represent.

We will build a functional workflow for quantitative S2O analyses that will test data interoperability via a real-world use case to highlight gaps encountered when using S&T.
