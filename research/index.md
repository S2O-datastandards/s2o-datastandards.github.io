Our project is focused on developing more precise semantic descriptions of mechanistic processes across the source-to-outcome (S2O) continuum. Environmental Health Science (EHS) spans a wide range of subdomains that comprise the S2O continuum (from chemical release and exposure to health outcomes) each generating unique and nuanced data. However, the current standards and terminologies across these subdomains are not well coordinated, limiting data interoperability and the seamless exchange of information.

## Goals of our research
{% capture text %}
To address these challenges, our work focuses on:
	•	**Engaging Stakeholders:** Collaborating with expert and stakeholder communities to define robust standards and terminologies.
	•	**Expanding the Biolink Model:** Advancing this framework to better describe chemical fate, exposure events, and biomarkers within environmental contexts.
	•	**Establishing a Functional Workflow:** Using a case study as a test system to validate our approach and strengthen predictive capabilities.

Through increasing the interoperability of available data, this initiative aims to bridge gaps in the S2O continuum and enhance the predictive power of environmental health data.

## Approach

Our approach involves a phased examination of overlapping EHS subdomains, with initial efforts focusing on the exposure and dosimetry subdomains (see figure below). For each subdomain, we will evaluate existing data and metadata standards and terminologies to identify gaps. We will use this information to extend the standards and terminologies to:
  1. ensure that collected data are interoperable across the different subdomains,
  2. promote the capture of metadata that are relevant for S2O analyses,
  3. facilitate machine readability and broader applications, and
  4. support integrated quantitative modelling of exposure, effect, and outcome.

The newly developed standards and terminologies will be rigorously tested through a functional use case, with plans to gradually expand this testing across additional subdomains throughout the project.
